Whereas:
(1) In the digital age, information and communication technology (ICT) suppor ts compl ex systems used for ever yday 
activities. It keeps our economies running in key sectors, including the financia l sector , and enhances the 
functioning of the intern al mark et. Increased digitalisation and interconnectedness also amplify ICT risk, making 
society as a whole, and the financial system in particular , more vulnerable to cyber threats or ICT disrupti ons. While 
the ubiquitous use of ICT systems and high digitalisation and connectivity are toda y core features of the activities of 
Union financial entities, their digital resilience has yet to be bette r addressed and integrat ed into their broader 
operational framew orks.
(2) The use of ICT has in the past decades gained a pivotal role in the provision of financial services, to the point where it 
has now acquired a critical importance in the operation of typical daily functions of all financial entities. 
Digitalisation now covers, for instance, payments, which have increasing ly mov ed from cash and paper -based 
methods to the use of digital solutions, as well as secur ities clear ing and settlement, electronic and algor ithmic 
trading, lending and funding operations, peer -to-peer finance, credit rating, claim management and back -office 
operations. The insurance sector has also been transf ormed by the use of ICT, from the emerge nce of insurance

interm ediar ies offer ing their services online operating with InsurT ech, to digital insurance under writing. Finance has 
not only become largely digital throughout the whole sector , but digitalisation has also deepened inter connections 
and dependencies within the financial sector and with third-par ty infrastr ucture and service provid ers.
(3) The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) reaff irmed in a 2020 repor t addressing system ic cyber risk how the 
existing high level of inter connectedness across financial entities, financial markets and financial mark et 
infrastr uctures, and particularly the interdependencies of their ICT systems , could constitute a systemic vulnerability 
because localised cyber incidents could quickly spread from any of the appro ximat ely 22 000 Union financia l 
entities to the entire financial system , unhindered by geographical boundar ies. Serious ICT breac hes that occur in 
the financial sector do not merely affect financial entities taken in isolation. They also smooth the way for the 
propagati on of localised vulnerabilities across the financial transmission channels and poten tially trigge r adverse 
consequences for the stability of the Union’s financia l system, such as generating liquidity runs and an overall loss 
of conf idence and trust in financia l markets.
(4) In recent years, ICT risk has attracted the attention of intern ational, Union and national policy makers, regulator s and 
standard-setting bodies in an attempt to enhance digital resilience, set standards and coordinate regulatory or 
super visor y work. At intern ational level, the Basel Committ ee on Banking Super vision, the Committee on Payments 
and Market Infrastr uctures, the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Stability Institute, as well as the G7 and G20 
aim to provide compet ent authorities and mark et operators across various jurisdictions with tools to bolster the 
resilience of their financial systems . That work has also been driven by the need to duly consider ICT risk in the 
conte xt of a highly interconnected global financial system and to seek more consistency of relevant best practices.
(5) Despite Union and national targe ted policy and legislative initiatives, ICT risk continues to pose a challenge to the 
operational resilience, performa nce and stability of the Union financial syste m. The reforms that follo wed the 2008 
financial crisis primar ily strengthened the financial resilience of the Union financial sector and aimed to safeguard 
the competitiveness and stability of the Union from economic, prudential and mark et conduct perspectives. 
Although ICT security and digital resilience are part of operational risk, they have been less in the focus of the post- 
financial crisis regulat ory agenda and have developed in only some areas of the Union’s financia l services policy and 
regulatory landscape, or in only a few Member States.
(6) In its Communication of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘FinTech Action plan: For a more competitive and innovative 
European financia l sector ’, the Commission highlight ed the paramount imp ortance of making the Union financial 
sector more resilient, including from an operational perspective to ensure its technological safety and good 
functioning, its quic k recovery from ICT breac hes and incidents, ultimat ely enabling the effective and smooth 
provision of financial services across the whole Union, including under situations of stress, while also preser ving 
consumer and mark et trust and conf idence.

(EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the European Super visor y Author ity

(5)Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European 
Super visor y Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and 
repealing Commission Decision 2009/79/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/2 27.12.2022  
European Parliament and of the Council (6)(known collectively as ‘European Super visor y authorities’ or ‘ESAs’) 
jointly issued technical advice calling for a coherent approac h to ICT risk in finance and recommending to 
strengthen, in a propor tionate way, the digital operational resilience of the financia l services industr y through a 
sector -specifi c initiative of the Union.
(8) The Union financial sector is regulated by a Sing le Rulebook and govern ed by a European system of financia l 
super vision. Nonetheless, provis ions tackli ng digital operational resilience and ICT security are not yet fully or 
consistently harmonised, despite digital operational resilience being vital for ensur ing financial stability and mark et 
integrit y in the digital age, and no less important than, for example, common prudential or mark et conduct 
standards. The Sing le Rulebook and system of super vision should theref ore be developed to also cover digital 
operational resilience, by strengthening the mandates of compet ent authorities to enable them to super vise the 
management of ICT risk in the financial sector in order to protect the integrity and efficiency of the internal market, 
and to facilitat e its orderly functioning.
(9) Legislative dispar ities and uneven national regulatory or super visor y approaches with regard to ICT risk trigger 
obstacles to the functioning of the internal mark et in financia l services, impeding the smooth exer cise of the 
freedom of establishment and the provis ion of services for financia l entities operating on a cross-border basis. 
Com petition between the same type of financial entities operating in differ ent Member States could also be 
distor ted. This is the case, in particular , for areas where Union harmonisation has been very limite d, such as digital 
operational resilience testing, or absent, such as the monitori ng of ICT third-par ty risk. Dispar ities stem ming from 
developments envisag ed at national level could generate further obstacles to the functioning of the intern al mark et 
to the detr iment of market participants and financial stability .
(10) To date, due to the ICT risk related provisions being only partially addressed at Union level, there are gaps or overlaps 
in important areas, such as ICT-related incident repor ting and digital operational resilience testing, and 
inconsiste ncies as a result of emerging diverge nt national rules or cost-ineff ective application of overlapping rules. 
This is particularly detr imental for an ICT-intensive user such as the financial sector since technology risks have no 
borders and the financial sector deplo ys its services on a wide cross-border basis within and outside the Union. 
Individual financia l entities operating on a cross-border basis or holding several author isations (e.g. one financial 
entity can have a banking, an investment firm, and a payment institution licence, each issued by a differ ent 
compet ent author ity in one or several Member States) face operational challenges in addressing ICT risk and 
mitig ating adverse impacts of ICT incidents on their own and in a coherent cost-eff ective way.
(11) As the Sing le Rulebook has not been accompanied by a compre hensive ICT or operational risk framework, further 
harmonisation of key digital operational resilience requirements for all financial entities is required. The 
development of ICT capabilities and overall resilience by financial entities, based on those key requirements, with a 
view to withstanding operational outag es, would help preser ve the stability and integr ity of the Union financial 
mark ets and thus contr ibut e to ensur ing a high level of protection of invest ors and consumers in the Union. Since 
this Regulation aims to contr ibut e to the smooth functioning of the internal mark et, it should be based on the 
provisions of

Article 114: of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as interpreted in

Legal Requirement:
accordance with the consiste nt case law of the Cour t of Justice of the European Union (Cour t of Justice).
(12) This Regulation aims to consolidat e and upgrade ICT risk requirements as part of the operational risk requirements 
that have, up to this point, been addressed separately in various Union legal acts. While those acts covered the main 
catego ries of financial risk (e.g. credit risk, mark et risk, counter party credit risk and liquidity risk, mark et conduct 
risk), they did not compreh ensively tackle, at the time of their adoption, all compo nents of operational resilience. 
The operational risk rules, when further developed in those Union legal acts, often favoured a traditional 
quantitative approach to addressing risk (namely setting a capital requirement to cover ICT risk) rather than target ed 
qualitative rules for the protection, detection, containment, reco very and repair capabilities against ICT-relat ed 
(6)Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European 
Super visor y Authorit y (European Secur ities and Mark ets Autho rity), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission 
Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/3  
incidents, or for repor ting and digital testing capabilities. Those acts were primar ily meant to cover and update 
essential rules on prudential super vision, mark et integr ity or conduct. By consolidating and upgrading the different 
rules on ICT risk, all provisions addressing digital risk in the financial sector should for the first time be brought 
together in a consiste nt manner in one sing le legislative act. Theref ore, this Regulation fills in the gaps or remedies 
inconsiste ncies in some of the prior legal acts, including in relation to the term inology used therein, and explicitly 
refers to ICT risk via target ed rules on ICT risk-management capabilities, incident repor ting, operational resilience 
testing and ICT third-par ty risk monitori ng. This Regulation should thus also raise awareness of ICT risk and 
ackn owledg e that ICT incidents and a lack of operational resilience have the possibility to jeopardise the soundness 
of financial entities.
(13) Financial entities should follo w the same approach and the same principle-based rules when addressing ICT risk 
taking into account their size and overall risk prof ile, and the nature, scale and compl exity of their services, 
activities and operations. Consisten cy contr ibut es to enhancing confidence in the financial syste m and preser ving its 
stability especially in times of high reliance on ICT systems, platf orms and infrastr uctures, whic h entails increased 
digital risk. Obser ving basic cyber hygiene should also avoid imposin g heavy costs on the economy by minimising 
the impact and costs of ICT disrupti ons.
(14) A Regulation helps reduce regulatory complexity , fosters super visor y converg ence and increases legal certainty , and 
also contr ibutes to limiting compl iance costs, especially for financial entities operating across borders, and to 
reducing compe titive distor tions. Theref ore, the choice of a Regulation for the establishment of a common 
framewor k for the digital operational resilience of financia l entities is the most appropr iate way to guarantee a 
homog enous and coherent application of all compo nents of ICT risk management by the Union financia l sector .
(15) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7)was the first horizontal cybersecurity 
framewor k enacted at Union level, applying also to three types of financial entities, namely credit institutions, 
trading venues and central counte rparties. Howe ver, since Directive (EU) 2016/1148 set out a mechanism of 
identif ication at national level of operat ors of essential services, only certain credit institutions, trading venues and 
central count erparties that were identif ied by the Member States, have been brought into its scope in practice, and 
hence required to compl y with the ICT security and incident notification requirements laid down in it. Directive 
(EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8)sets a unif orm criterion to determine the entities 
falling within its scope of application (size-cap rule) while also keeping the three types of financial entities in its 
scope.
(16) However , as this Regulation increases the level of harmonisation of the various digital resilience components, by 
introducing requirements on ICT risk management and ICT-relat ed incident repor ting that are more stringent in 
compari son to those laid down in the current Union financial services law, this higher level constitute s an increased 
harmonisation also in compar ison with the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Consequently , this 
Regulation constitutes lex specialis with regar d to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. At the same time, it is crucial to 
maintain a strong relationship between the financial sector and the Union horizontal cybersecurity framework as 
currently laid out in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 to ensure consist ency with the cyber security strategies adopt ed by 
Member States and to allow financia l super visors to be made awar e of cyber incidents affecting other sectors 
covered by that Directive.

level of security of netwo rk and information systems across the Union (OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1).

Article 4: (2) of the Treaty on European Union and without prejudice to the judicial review by the

Legal Requirement:
Cour t of Justice, this Regulation should not affect the responsibility of Member States with regar d to essential State 
functions concer ning public security, defe nce and the safeg uarding of national security, for example concer ning the 
supply of information which would be contrar y to the safeguarding of national security.
(18) To enable cross-sect or learning and to effectively draw on exper iences of other sector s in dealing with cyber threats, 
the financial entities refer red to in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 should remain part of the ‘ecosyst em’ of that Directive 
(for examp le, Cooperation Group and comput er security incident response teams (CSIRT s)).The ESA s and national 
compet ent authorities should be able to participat e in the strategic policy discussions and the technical workings of 
the Cooperation Group under that Directive, and to exchang e information and further cooperate with the sing le 
points of contact designat ed or established in accordance with that Directive. The compet ent authorities under this 
Regulation should also consult and cooperate with the CSIRT s. The compet ent authorities should also be able to 
request technical advice from the compet ent authorities designat ed or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 
2022/2555 and establish cooperation arrangements that aim to ensure effective and fast-response coordination 
mechani sms.
(19) Given the strong inter linkages between the digital resilience and the physical resilience of financial entities, a 
coherent approach with regar d to the resilience of critical entities is necessar y in this Regulation and Directive (EU) 
2022/2557 of the European Parliament and the Council (9). Given that the physical resilience of financial entities is 
addressed in a compreh ensive manner by the ICT risk management and repor ting oblig ations covered by this 
Regulation, the oblig ations laid down in Chapt ers III and IV of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 should not apply to 
financial entities falling within the scope of that Directive.
(20) Cloud computi ng service provid ers are one catego ry of digital infrastr ucture covered by Directive (EU) 2022/2555. 
The Union Oversight Framew ork (‘Oversight framework’) established by this Regulation applies to all critical ICT 
third-par ty service provid ers, including cloud computing service providers providing ICT services to financial 
entities, and should be considered compl ementar y to the super vision carried out pursuant to Directive (EU) 2022/ 
2555. Moreover , the Oversight Framew ork established by this Regulation should cover cloud computi ng service 
provid ers in the absence of a Union horizontal framew ork establishing a digital oversight author ity.
(21) In order to maintain full control over ICT risk, financial entities need to have comprehensive capabilities to enable a 
strong and effective ICT risk management, as well as specif ic mechanisms and policies for handling all ICT-relat ed 
incidents and for repor ting major ICT-related incidents. Likewise, financial entities should have policies in place for 
the testing of ICT system s, controls and processes, as well as for managing ICT third-par ty risk. The digital 
operational resilience baseline for financia l entities should be increased while also allowing for a propor tionate 
application of requirements for certain financial entities, particularly microent erprises, as well as financial entities 
subject to a simplified ICT risk management framework. To facilitat e an efficient super vision of institutions for 
occupational retirement provision that is propor tionate and addresses the need to reduce administrative burdens on 
the compet ent authorities, the relevant national super visor y arrangements in respect of such financial entities should 
take into account their size and overall risk prof ile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities 
and operations even when the relevant thresholds established in

Article 31: of Directive (EU)

Legal Requirement:
2016/2341, outsource a signif icant part of their core business, such as asset management, actuar ial calculations, 
accounting and data management , to service providers.
(22) ICT-relat ed incident repor ting thresholds and taxonomies vary significantly at national level. While common ground 
may be achi eved through the relevant work under taken by the European Union Agen cy for Cybersecurity (ENIS A) 
established by Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11)and the Cooperation 
Group under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, diverge nt approach es on setting the thresholds and use of taxonomies still 
exist, or can emerg e, for the remainder of financial entities. Due to those diverg ences, there are multiple 
requirements that financial entities must compl y with, especially when operating across several Member State s and 
when part of a financial group. Moreover , such diverg ences have the poten tial to hinder the creation of further 
unif orm or centralised Union mechani sms that speed up the repor ting process and suppor t a quic k and smooth 
exchange of information between compet ent authorities, whic h is crucial for addressing ICT risk in the event of 
large-scale attac ks with poten tially systemic consequences.
(23) To reduce the administrative burden and poten tially duplicative repor ting oblig ations for certain financial entities, 
the requirement for the incident repor ting pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council (12)should cease to apply to payment service providers that fall within the scope of this Regulation.

Article 33: (1) of that Directive, should, from the date of application of this Regulation,

Legal Requirement:
repor t pursuant to this Regulation, all operational or security payment-related incidents which have been previously 
repor ted pursuant to that Directive, irrespective of whether such incidents are ICT-relate d.
(24) To enable compet ent authorities to fulfil super visor y roles by acquir ing a compl ete over view of the nature, 
frequency , signif icance and impact of ICT-related incidents and to enhance the exchange of information between 
relevant public authorities, including law enforcement authorities and resolution authorities, this Regulation should 
lay down a robust ICT-relate d incident repor ting regime whereby the relevant requirements address current gaps in 
financial services law, and remove existing overlaps and duplications to alleviate costs. It is essential to harmonise 
the ICT-related incident repor ting regime by requir ing all financial entities to repor t to their compet ent authorities 
through a sing le streamlined framewor k as set out in this Regulation. In addition, the ESA s should be empowered to 
further specify relevant elements for the ICT-relate d incident repor ting framework, such as taxonomy , timeframes, 
data sets, templates and applicable thresholds. To ensure full consist ency with Directive (EU) 2022/2555, financial 
entities should be allowed, on a voluntar y basis, to notify signif icant cyber threats to the relevant compet ent 
author ity, when they consider that the cyber threat is of relevance to the financial system , service users or clients.
(25) Digital operational resilience testing requirements have been developed in certain financia l subsect ors setting out 
framewor ks that are not alwa ys fully aligned. This leads to a poten tial duplication of costs for cross-border financial 
entities and mak es the mutual recognition of the results of digital operational resilience testing compl ex which, in 
turn, can fragment the intern al market.
(11)Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 Apr il 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency 
for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) 
No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15).
(12)Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the inter nal 
market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing 
Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/6 27.12.2022  
(26) In addition, where no ICT testing is required, vulnerabilities remain undete cted and result in exposing a financia l 
entity to ICT risk and ultimat ely creat e a higher risk to the stability and integrity of the financial sector . Without 
Union inter vention, digital operational resilience testing would continue to be inconsistent and would lack a system 
of mutual recognition of ICT testing results across different jurisdictions. In addition, as it is unlikely that other 
financial subsect ors would adop t testing sche mes on a meaningful scale, they would miss out on the poten tial 
benefits of a testing framework, in term s of revealing ICT vulnerabilities and risks, and testing defence capabilities 
and business continuity , which contr ibutes to increasing the trust of customer s, suppliers and business partners. To 
remedy those overlaps, diverg ences and gaps, it is necessar y to lay down rules for a coordinated testing regime and 
thereby facilitate the mutual recognition of advanced testing for financial entities meeting the criteria set out in this 
Regulation.
(27) Financial entities’ reliance on the use of ICT services is partly driven by their need to adapt to an emerging 
competitive digital global economy , to boost their business efficiency and to meet consumer demand. The nature 
and extent of such reliance has been continuously evolving in recent years, driving cost reduction in financial 
interm ediation, enabling business expansion and scalability in the deplo yment of financial activities while offering a 
wide rang e of ICT tools to manage compl ex internal processes.
(28) The exte nsive use of ICT services is evidenced by complex contractual arrangements, whereby financia l entities often 
encounter difficulties in negotiating contractual terms that are tailored to the prudential standards or other 
regulatory requirements to whic h they are subject, or other wise in enforcing specifi c rights, such as access or audit 
rights, even when the latter are enshr ined in their contractual arrangements. Moreover , many of those contractual 
arrange ments do not provid e for suffi cient safeg uards allowing for the fully-f ledged monitoring of subcontracting 
processes, thus depr iving the financial entity of its ability to assess the associate d risks. In addition, as ICT third-party service providers often provide standardised services to diffe rent types of clients, such contractual 
arrange ments do not alwa ys cater adequately for the individual or specific needs of financial industr y actors.
(29) Even though Union financia l services law contains certain general rules on outsourcing, monitoring of the 
contractual dimension is not fully anchored into Union law. In the absence of clear and bespoke Union standards 
applying to the contractual arrange ments concluded with ICT third-par ty service providers, the extern al source of 
ICT risk is not compreh ensively addressed. Consequently , it is necessar y to set out certain key principles to guide 
financial entities ’ manag ement of ICT third-par ty risk, whic h are of particular impor tance when financia l entities 
resor t to ICT third-par ty service provid ers to suppor t their critical or important functions. Those principles should 
be accompan ied by a set of core contractual rights in relation to several elements in the performance and 
term ination of contractual arrangements with a view to providin g certain minimum safeg uards in order to 
strengthen financia l entities’ ability to effectively monitor all ICT risk emerging at the level of third-par ty service 
provid ers. Those principles are compl ementar y to the sectoral law applicable to outsourcing.
(30) A certain lack of homogeneity and converg ence regarding the monitori ng of ICT third-par ty risk and ICT third-par ty 
dependencies is evident toda y. Despite efforts to address outsourcing, such as EBA guidelines on outsourcing of 
2019 and ESMA guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers of 2021 the broader issue of counteracting 
systemic risk which may be trigge red by the financial sector ’s exposure to a limited number of critical ICT third-party service providers is not suffi ciently addressed by Union law. The lack of rules at Union level is compo unded 
by the absence of national rules on mandates and tools that allow financial super visors to acquire a good 
understanding of ICT third-par ty dependencies and to monitor adequat ely risks arising from the concentration of 
ICT third-par ty dependencies.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/7  
(31) Taking into account the poten tial systemic risk entailed by increased outsourcing practices and by the ICT third-party concentration, and mindful of the insufficiency of national mechani sms in providing financial super visors 
with adequate tools to quantify , qualify and redress the consequences of ICT risk occur ring at critical ICT third-par ty 
service providers, it is necessar y to establish an appropr iate Oversight Framew ork allowing for a continuous 
monitori ng of the activities of ICT third-par ty service provid ers that are critical ICT third-par ty service providers to 
financial entities, while ensur ing that the conf identiality and security of custome rs other than financia l entities is 
preser ved. While intra-group provision of ICT services entails specific risks and benefits, it should not be 
automatical ly considered less risky than the provision of ICT services by providers outside of a financial group and 
should theref ore be subject to the same regulator y framew ork. Howe ver, when ICT services are provid ed from 
within the same financial group, financial entities might have a higher level of control over intra-group providers, 
which ought to be take n into account in the overall risk assessment.
(32) With ICT risk becoming more and more compl ex and sophisticat ed, good measures for the detection and prevention 
of ICT risk depend to a great extent on the regular shar ing between financial entities of threat and vulnerability 
intellig ence. information shar ing contr ibut es to creating increased awareness of cyber threats. In turn, this enhances 
the capacity of financial entities to prevent cyber threats from becoming real ICT-relat ed incidents and enables 
financial entities to more effectively contain the impa ct of ICT-relat ed incidents and to recover faster. In the absence 
of guidance at Union level, several factors seem to have inhibite d such intelligence shar ing, in particular uncer tainty 
about its compati bility with data prote ction, anti-tr ust and liability rules.
(33) In addition, doubts about the type of information that can be shared with other mark et participants, or with non- 
super visor y authorities (suc h as ENISA, for analytical input, or Europol, for law enforcement purposes) lead to 
useful information being withheld. Theref ore, the extent and quality of information shar ing currently remains 
limited and fragmented, with relevant exchang es mostly being local (by way of national initiatives) and with no 
consistent Union-wide information-shar ing arrange ments tailored to the needs of an integrat ed financial system. It 
is theref ore impor tant to strengthen those communication channels.
(34) Financial entities should be encouraged to exchange among themselves cyber threat information and intelligence, 
and to collectively leverage their individual knowledg e and practical exper ience at strateg ic, tactical and operational 
levels with a view to enhancing their capabilities to adequately assess, monitor , defend against, and respond to cyber 
threats, by participating in information shar ing arrange ments. It is theref ore necessar y to enable the emerge nce at 
Union level of mechanisms for voluntar y information-shar ing arrangements whic h, when conducted in trusted 
environments, would help the community of the financia l industr y to prevent and collectively respond to cyber 
threats by quickly limiting the spread of ICT risk and impedi ng poten tial contagion throughout the financial 
channels. Those mechanis ms should compl y with the applicable competiti on law rules of the Union set out in the

Legal Requirement:
respectively , of that Regulation.
(13)Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 Apr il 2016 on the prot ection of natural persons with 
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data 
Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/8 27.12.2022  
(35) In order to maintain a high level of digital operational resilience for the whole financia l sector, and at the same time 
to keep pace with technological developments, this Regulation should address risk stemming from all types of ICT 
services. To that end, the definit ion of ICT services in the context of this Regulation should be underst ood in a 
broad manner , encompassing digital and data services provid ed through ICT systems to one or more intern al or 
external users on an ongoing basis. That definition should, for instance, include so called ‘over the top’ services, 
which fall within the cate gory of electronic communications services. It should excl ude only the limited catego ry of 
traditional analogue telephone services qualifying as Public Switc hed Telephone Network (PSTN) services, landline 
services, Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), or fixed-line telep hone services.
(36) Notwithstanding the broad coverag e envisaged by this Regulation, the application of the digital operational resilience 
rules should take into account the significant differences between financia l entities in terms of their size and overall 
risk prof ile. As a general principle, when distr ibuting resources and capabilities for the implementation of the ICT 
risk management framework, financia l entities should duly balance their ICT-relate d needs to their size and overall 
risk profile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their services, activities and operations, while compet ent 
authorities should continue to assess and review the approach of such distr ibution.

amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/10 27.12.2022  
changes following post ICT-relat ed incident reviews; to monitor on a continuous basis relevant technological 
developments, to establish a comprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an integral part of 
the ICT risk management framew ork provi ded for in this Regulation, or to adopt and regularly review a strategy on 
ICT third-par ty risk. In addition, microenter prises should only be required to assess the need to maintain such 
redundant ICT capacities based on their risk prof ile. Microenter prises should benefit from a more flexible regime as 
regards digital operational resilience testing programmes. When consider ing the type and frequency of testing to be 
performe d, they should properly balance the objective of maintaining a high digital operational resilience, the 
available resources and their overall risk profile. Microente rprises and financial entities subject to the simplified ICT 
risk management framework under this Regulation should be exem pted from the requirement to perf orm advanced 
testing of ICT tools, syste ms and processes based on threat-led penetration testing (TLPT), as only financial entities 
meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation should be required to carry out such testing. In light of their limited 
capabilities, microenter prises should be able to agree with the ICT third-par ty service provider to delegat e the 
financial entity’s rights of access, inspection and audit to an independent third-par ty, to be appointed by the ICT 
third-par ty service provi der, provided that the financial entity is able to request, at any time, all relevant information 
and assurance on the ICT third-par ty service provider ’s performa nce from the respective independent third-par ty.
(44) As only those financia l entities identified for the purposes of the advanced digital resilience testing should be 
required to conduct threat-led penetration tests, the administrative processes and financial costs entailed in the 
performa nce of such tests should be borne by a small percentage of financial entities.
(45) To ensure full alignment and overall consist ency between financial entities’ business strateg ies, on the one hand, and 
the conduct of ICT risk manag ement, on the other hand, the financial entities ’ management bodies should be 
required to maintain a pivotal and active role in steering and adapt ing the ICT risk management framework and the 
overall digital operational resilience strateg y. The approach to be taken by management bodies should not only focus 
on the means of ensur ing the resilience of the ICT systems, but should also cover people and processes through a set 
of policies whic h cultivate, at each corporat e layer, and for all staff, a strong sense of aware ness about cyber risks and 
a commitment to obser ve a strict cyber hygiene at all levels. The ultimat e responsibility of the management body in 
managing a financia l entity’s ICT risk should be an overarching principle of that comprehensive approach, further 
translate d into the continuous engagement of the management body in the control of the monit oring of the ICT 
risk management.
(46) Moreover , the principle of the management body’s full and ultimat e responsibility for the management of the ICT 
risk of the financial entity goes hand in hand with the need to secure a level of ICT-relate d inve stments and an 
overall budget for the financial entity that would enable the financial entity to achi eve a high level of digital 
operational resilience.
(47) Inspired by relevant international, national and industr y best practices, guidelines, recommendations and 
approach es to the management of cyber risk, this Regulation promot es a set of principles that facilitate the overall 
structure of ICT risk management. Consequently , as long as the main capabilities which financial entities put in 
place address the various functions in the ICT risk manag ement (identification, prot ection and prevention, 
detection, response and reco very, learning and evolving and communication) set out in this Regulation, financia l 
entities should remain free to use ICT risk management models that are differ ently framed or catego rised.
(48) To keep pace with an evolving cyber threat landscape, financial entities should maintain updat ed ICT systems that are 
reliable and capable, not only for guaranteeing the processing of data required for their services, but also for ensur ing 
suffi cient technological resilience to allow them to deal adequate ly with additional processing needs due to stressed 
mark et conditions or other adverse situations.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/11  
(49) Efficient business continuity and recovery plans are necessar y to allow financial entities to promp tly and quickly 
resolve ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber -attacks, by limiting damage and giving priority to the resum ption 
of activities and reco very actions in accordance with their back -up policies. However , such resum ption should in no 
way jeopardise the integrit y and security of the netw ork and information system s or the availability , authenticity , 
integrit y or conf identiality of data.
(50) While this Regulation allows financial entities to determine their reco very time and recovery point objectives in a 
flexible manner and hence to set such objectives by fully taking into account the nature and the criticality of the 
relevant functions and any specific business needs, it should never theless require them to carry out an assessment of 
the poten tial overall impa ct on market efficiency when determi ning such objectives.
(51) The propagat ors of cyber -attacks tend to pursue financial gains directly at the source, thus exposing financial entities 
to significant consequences. To prevent ICT systems from losing integr ity or becoming unavailable, and hence to 
avoid data breac hes and damag e to physical ICT infrastr ucture, the repor ting of major ICT-related incidents by 
financial entities should be signif icantly improved and streamlined. ICT-related incident repor ting should be 
harmonised through the introduction of a requirement for all financial entities to repor t directly to their relevant 
compet ent authorities. Where a financial entity is subject to super vision by more than one national compet ent 
author ity, Member States should designate a sing le compet ent author ity as the addressee of such repor ting. Credit 
institutions classif ied as significant in accordance with

Article 6: (4) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (19)

Legal Requirement:
should submit such repor ting to the national compet ent authorities, whic h should subsequently transmit the repor t 
to the European Central Bank (ECB).
(52) The direct repor ting should enable financial super visors to have immediate access to information about major ICT- 
relat ed incidents. Financial super visors should in turn pass on details of major ICT-related incidents to public non- 
financial authorities (suc h as compet ent authorities and sing le points of contact under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, 
national data prot ection authorities, and to law enforcement authorities for major ICT-related incidents of a 
criminal nature) in order to enhance such authorities awar eness of such incidents and, in the case of CSIRT s, to 
facilitate prom pt assistance that may be given to financia l entities, as appropr iate. Member States should, in 
addition, be able to deter mine that financial entities themselves should provide such information to public 
authorities outside the financial services area. Those information flows should allow financial entities to swif tly 
benefit from any relevant technical input, advice about remedies, and subsequent follo w-up from such authorities. 
The information on major ICT-relat ed incidents should be mutually channelled: financial super visors should 
provid e all necessar y feedback or guidance to the financial entity , while the ESA s should share anonymised data on 
cyber threats and vulnerabilities relating to an incident, to aid wider collective defence.
(53) While all financia l entities should be required to carry out incident repor ting, that requirement is not expect ed to 
affect all of them in the same manner . Indeed, relevant mate riality thresholds, as well as repor ting timelines, should 
be duly adjusted, in the conte xt of delegat ed acts based on the regulatory technical standards to be developed by the 
ESA s, with a view to cover ing only major ICT-relat ed incidents. In addition, the specifi cities of financial entities 
should be taken into account when setting timelines for repor ting obligations.
(54) This Regulation should require credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service provid ers and 
electronic mone y institutions to repor t all operational or security payment-relate d incidents – previously repor ted 
under Directive (EU) 2015/2366 – irrespective of the ICT nature of the incident.
(19)Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 Octo ber 2013 conf erring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concer ning 
policies relating to the prudential super vision of credit institutions (OJ L 287, 29.10.2013, p. 63).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/12 27.12.2022  
(55) The ESAs should be task ed with assessing the feasibility and conditions for a possible centralisation of ICT-relate d 
incident repor ts at Union level. Such centralisation could consist of a sing le EU Hub for major ICT-relate d incident 
repor ting either directly receiving relevant repor ts and automatical ly notifying national compe tent authorities, or 
merely centralising relevant repor ts forwarded by the national compe tent authorities and thus fulfilling a 
coordination role. The ESA s should be taske d with prepar ing, in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, a joint 
repor t explor ing the feasibility of setting up a sing le EU Hub.
(56) In order to achieve a high level of digital operational resilience, and in line with both the relevant intern ational 
standards (e.g. the G7 Fundamental Elements for Threat-Led Penetration testing) and with the frameworks applied 
in the Union, such as the TIBER -EU, financial entities should regularly test their ICT systems and staff having ICT- 
relat ed responsibilities with rega rd to the effectiveness of their preventive, detection, response and reco very 
capabilities, to uncov er and address pote ntial ICT vulnerabilities. To reflect differ ences that exist across, and within, 
the various financial subsectors as regards financia l entities ’ level of cybersecurity preparedness, testing should 
include a wide variety of tools and actions, ranging from the assessment of basic requirements (e.g. vulnerability 
assessments and scans, open source analyses, network security assessments, gap analyses, physical security reviews, 
questionnaires and scanning software solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenar io-based tests, 
compati bility testing, performance testing or end-to- end testing) to more advanced testing by means of TLPT . Such 
advanced testing should be required only of financial entities that are mature enough from an ICT perspective to 
reasonably carry it out. The digital operational resilience testing required by this Regulation should thus be more 
demanding for those financia l entities meeting the criteria set out in this Regulation (for example, large, syste mic 
and ICT-mature credit institutions, stock exchanges , central secur ities depositori es and central count erparties) than 
for other financia l entities. At the same time, the digital operational resilience testing by means of TLPT should be 
more relevant for financial entities operating in core financia l services subsect ors and playing a systemic role (for 
example, payments, banking, and clear ing and settlement), and less relevant for other subsect ors (for example, asset 
manage rs and credit rating agencies).
(57) Financial entities involved in cross-border activities and exercising the freedoms of establishment, or of provision of 
services within the Union, should compl y with a sing le set of advanced testing requirements (i.e. TLPT) in their home 
Member State, whic h should include the ICT infrastr uctures in all jurisdictions where the cross-border financial 
group operat es within the Union, thus allowing such cross-border financial groups to incur relat ed ICT testing costs 
in one jurisdiction only .
(58) To draw on the exper tise already acquired by certain compet ent authorities, in particular with regar d to 
imp lementing the TIBER -EU framework, this Regulation should allow Member States to designate a sing le public 
author ity as responsible in the financial sector , at national level, for all TLPT matt ers, or compet ent authorities, to 
delegat e, in the absence of such designation, the exercise of TLPT related tasks to another national financial 
compet ent author ity.
(59) Since this Regulation does not require financia l entities to cover all critical or important functions in one sing le 
threat-led penetration test, financia l entities should be free to deter mine whic h and how many critical or impor tant 
functions should be included in the scope of such a test.
(60) Pooled testing within the meaning of this Regulation – involving the participation of several financial entities in a 
TLPT and for whic h an ICT third-par ty service provider can directly enter into contractual arrangements with an 
external tester – should be allowed only where the quality or security of services delivered by the ICT third-par ty 
service provid er to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation, or the conf identiality of 
the data relat ed to such services, are reasonably expect ed to be adversely impacted . Pooled testing should also be 
subject to safeg uards (direction by one designated financia l entity , calibration of the number of participating 
financial entities) to ensure a rigorous testing exercise for the financia l entities involved whic h meet the objectives of 
the TLPT pursuant to this Regulation.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/13  
(61) In order to take advantag e of internal resources available at corporat e level, this Regulation should allow the use of 
internal testers for the purposes of carrying out TLPT , provid ed there is super visor y appro val, no conf licts of 
inter est, and periodical alternation of the use of internal and external testers (ever y three tests ), while also requir ing 
the provid er of the threat intellig ence in the TLPT to alwa ys be external to the financial entity . The responsibility for 
conducting TLPT should remain fully with the financial entity . Attest ations provid ed by authorities should be solely 
for the purpose of mutual recognition and should not preclude any follow-up action needed to address the ICT risk 
to which the financial entity is exposed, nor should they be seen as a super visor y endorsement of a financial entity’s 
ICT risk manag ement and mitig ation capabilities.
(62) To ensure a sound monitoring of ICT third-par ty risk in the financial sector , it is necessar y to lay down a set of 
principle-based rules to guide financia l entities ’ when monitori ng risk arising in the context of functions outsourced 
to ICT third-par ty service provi ders, particularly for ICT services suppor ting critical or imp ortant functions, as well 
as more general ly in the context of all ICT third-par ty dependencies.
(63) To address the compl exity of the various sources of ICT risk, while taking into account the multitude and diversity of 
provid ers of technological solutions which enable a smooth provision of financial services, this Regulation should 
cover a wide rang e of ICT third-par ty service providers, including provi ders of cloud computing services, software, 
data analytics services and provid ers of data centre services. Similarly , since financial entities should effectively and 
coherently identify and manage all types of risk, including in the conte xt of ICT services procured within a financial 
group, it should be clarified that under takings whic h are part of a financial group and provi de ICT services 
predominantly to their parent under taking, or to subsidiar ies or branches of their parent under taking, as well as 
financial entities provid ing ICT services to other financial entities, should also be considered as ICT third-par ty 
service provid ers under this Regulation. Lastly , in light of the evolving payment services mark et becoming 
increasing ly dependent on compl ex technical solutions, and in view of emerging types of payment services and 
payment-related solutions, participants in the payment services ecosystem , providing payment-processing activities, 
or operating payment infrastr uctures, should also be considered to be ICT third-par ty service providers under this 
Regulation, with the exce ption of central banks when operating payment or secur ities settlement systems , and 
public authorities when provi ding ICT relat ed services in the context of fulfilling State functions.
(64) A financial entity should at all times remain fully responsible for compl ying with its oblig ations set out in this 
Regulation. Financial entities should apply a propor tionat e approach to the monitori ng of risks emerging at the 
level of the ICT third-par ty service providers, by duly consider ing the nature, scale, compl exity and impor tance of 
their ICT-relat ed dependencies, the criticality or importance of the services, processes or functions subject to the 
contractual arrangements and, ultimat ely, on the basis of a careful assessment of any potential impact on the 
continuity and quality of financial services at individual and at group level, as appropr iate.
(65) The conduct of such monitori ng should follow a strategic approach to ICT third-par ty risk formalised through the 
adoptio n by the financial entity’s managemen t body of a dedicated ICT third-par ty risk strateg y, rooted in a 
continuous screening of all ICT third-par ty dependencies. To enhance super visor y awareness of ICT third-par ty 
dependencies, and with a view to further suppor ting the work in the cont ext of the Oversight Framew ork 
established by this Regulation, all financial entities should be required to maintain a register of information with all 
contractual arrangements about the use of ICT services provi ded by ICT third-par ty service provid ers. Financial 
super visors should be able to request the full register , or to ask for specifi c sections thereof, and thus to obtain 
essential information for acquir ing a broader understanding of the ICT dependencies of financial entities.
(66) A thorough pre-contracting analysis should under pin and precede the formal conclusion of contractual 
arrange ments, in particular by focusing on elements such as the criticality or impor tance of the services suppor ted 
by the envisag ed ICT contract, the necessar y super visor y approvals or other conditions, the possible concentration 
risk entailed, as well as applying due diligence in the process of selection and assessment of ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers and assessing pote ntial conf licts of inter est. For contractual arrange ments concer ning critical or 
imp ortant functions, financial entities should take into consideration the use by ICT third-par ty service provi ders of 
the most up-to -date and highest information security standards. Termination of contractual arrangements could be 
promp ted at least by a series of circumstances showing shor tfalls at the ICT third-par ty service provider level, in EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/14 27.12.2022  
particular signif icant breac hes of laws or contractual term s, circumstances revealing a poten tial alteration of the 
performa nce of the functions provid ed for in the contractual arrangements, evidence of weaknesses of the ICT 
third-par ty service provider in its overall ICT risk management, or circumstances indicating the inability of the 
relevant compet ent author ity to effectively super vise the financial entity .
(67) To address the systemic impact of ICT third-par ty concentration risk, this Regulation promotes a balanced solution 
by means of taking a flexible and gradual approach to such concentration risk since the imp osition of any rigid caps 
or strict limitations might hinder the conduct of business and restrain the contractual freedom. Financial entities 
should thoroughly assess their envisag ed contractual arrangements to identify the likelihood of such risk emerging, 
including by means of in-depth analyses of subcontracting arrangements, in particular when concluded with ICT 
third-par ty service provid ers established in a third countr y. At this stage, and with a view to striking a fair balance 
between the imperative of preser ving contractual freedom and that of guarant eeing financial stability , it is not 
considered appropr iate to set out rules on strict caps and limits to ICT third-par ty exposures. In the conte xt of the 
Oversight Framew ork, a Lead Overseer , appointed pursuant to this Regulation, should, in respect to critical ICT 
third-par ty service providers, pay particular attention to fully grasp the magnitude of interdependences, disco ver 
specifi c instances where a high degree of concentration of critical ICT third-par ty service provi ders in the Union is 
likely to put a strain on the Union financial system’s stability and integrit y and maintain a dialogue with critical ICT 
third-par ty service provid ers where that specif ic risk is identified.
(68) To evaluate and monitor on a regular basis the ability of an ICT third party service provi der to securely provide 
services to a financial entity without adverse effects on a financial entity’s digital operational resilience, several key 
contractual elements with ICT third-par ty service providers should be harmonised. Such harmonisation should 
cover minimum areas whic h are crucial for enabling a full monitori ng by the financial entity of the risks that could 
emerge from the ICT third-par ty service provider , from the perspective of a financial entity’s need to secure its 
digital resilience because it is deeply dependent on the stability , functionality , availability and security of the ICT 
services received.
(69) When renegotiating contractual arrange ments to seek alignment with the requirements of this Regulation, financial 
entities and ICT third-par ty service provid ers should ensure the coverag e of the key contractual provis ions as 
provid ed for in this Regulation.
(70) The definition of ‘critical or important function’ provided for in this Regulation encompasses the ‘critical functions’ 
as defined in

Article 2: (1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20).

Legal Requirement:
According ly, functions deemed to be critical pursuant to Directive 2014/59/EU are included in the definition of 
critical functions within the meaning of this Regulation.
(71) Irrespective of the criticality or importance of the function suppor ted by the ICT services, contractual arrange ments 
should, in particular , provide for a specif ication of the compl ete descr iptions of functions and services, of the 
locations where such functions are provided and where data is to be processed, as well as an indication of service 
level descr iptions. Other essential elements to enable a financial entity’s monitori ng of ICT third party risk are: 
contractual provisions specifying how the accessibility , availability , integr ity, security and prot ection of personal 
data are ensured by the ICT third-par ty service provider , provis ions laying down the relevant guarantees for 
enabling the access, recovery and retur n of data in the case of insolvency , resolution or discontinuation of the 
business operations of the ICT third-par ty service provider , as well as provisions requir ing the ICT third-par ty 
service provid er to provid e assistance in case of ICT incidents in connection with the services provid ed, at no 
additional cost or at a cost deter mined ex-ante; provi sions on the obligation of the ICT third-par ty service provid er 
(20)Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recover y and 
resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 
2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) 
No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 190).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/15  
to fully cooperate with the compet ent authorities and resolution authorities of the financial entity ; and provisions on 
term ination rights and relat ed minimum notice periods for the term ination of the contractual arrange ments, in 
accordance with the expectations of compe tent authorities and resolution authorities.
(72) In addition to such contractual provisions, and with a view to ensur ing that financial entities remain in full control of 
all developments occur ring at third-par ty level whic h may impair their ICT security, the contracts for the provis ion 
of ICT services suppor ting critical or important functions should also provide for the follo wing: the specifi cation of 
the full service level descr iptions, with precise quantitative and qualitative perf ormance targets , to enable without 
undue dela y appropr iate corrective actions when the agreed service levels are not met ; the relevant notice periods 
and repor ting oblig ations of the ICT third-par ty service provid er in the event of developments with a potential 
mater ial impa ct on the ICT third-par ty service provi der’s ability to effectively provid e their respective ICT services; a 
requirement upon the ICT third-par ty service provid er to implement and test business continge ncy plans and have 
ICT security measures, tools and policies allowing for the secure provision of services, and to participat e and fully 
cooperate in the TLPT carried out by the financial entity .
(73) Contracts for the provi sion of ICT services suppor ting critical or impor tant functions should also contain provi sions 
enabling the rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity , or an appointed third party, and the right to 
take copies as crucial instr uments in the financial entities’ ongoing monitori ng of the ICT third-par ty service 
provid er’s perf ormance, coupled with the service provider ’s full cooperation during inspections. Similarly , the 
compet ent author ity of the financial entity should have the right, based on notices, to inspect and audit the ICT 
third-par ty service provid er, subject to the prote ction of conf idential information.
(74) Such contractual arrangements should also provide for dedicat ed exit strate gies to enable, in particular , mandatory 
transition periods during which ICT third-par ty service providers should continue provid ing the relevant services 
with a view to reducing the risk of disruptions at the level of the financia l entity , or to allow the latte r effectively to 
switc h to the use of other ICT third-par ty service providers or, altern atively , to chang e to in-house solutions, 
consistent with the complexity of the provid ed ICT service. Moreover , financial entities within the scope of Directive 
2014/59/EU should ensure that the relevant contracts for ICT services are robust and fully enforceable in the event of 
resolution of those financial entities. Theref ore, in line with the expectations of the resolution authorities, those 
financial entities should ensure that the relevant contracts for ICT services are resolution resilient. As long as they 
continue meeting their payment oblig ations, those financial entities should ensure, among other requirements, that 
the relevant contracts for ICT services contain clauses for non-termina tion, non-suspension and non-modif ication 
on grounds of restr uctur ing or resolution.
(75) Moreover , the voluntar y use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities or Union institutions, in 
particular the use of contractual clauses developed by the Commission for cloud computing services could provid e 
further comf ort to the financial entities and ICT third-par ty service provid ers, by enhancing their level of legal 
certainty rega rding the use of cloud computing services in the financial sector , in full alignment with the 
requirements and expectations set out by the Union financial services law. The development of standard contractual 
clauses builds on measures already envisag ed in the 2018 Fintec h Action Plan that announced the Commission’s 
intenti on to encourage and facilitate the development of standard contractual clauses for the use of cloud 
computi ng services outsourcing by financial entities, drawing on cross-sector ial cloud computing services 
stake holders ’ efforts, whic h the Commission has facilitated with the help of the financial sector ’s involvement.
(76) With a view to promoting conver gence and efficiency in relation to super visor y approac hes when addressing ICT 
third-par ty risk in the financial sector , as well as to strengthening the digital operational resilience of financial 
entities which rely on critical ICT third-par ty service providers for the provision of ICT services that suppor t the 
supply of financial services, and thereby to contr ibuting to the preser vation of the Union’s financial system stability 
and the integrity of the intern al market for financia l services, critical ICT third-par ty service providers should be 
subject to a Union Oversight Framew ork. While the set-up of the Oversight Framew ork is justified by the added 
value of taking action at Union level and by virtue of the inherent role and specific ities of the use of ICT services in EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/16 27.12.2022  
the provision of financia l services, it should be recalled, at the same time, that this solution appears suitable only in 
the context of this Regulation specifi cally dealing with digital operational resilience in the financial sector . However , 
such Oversight Framew ork should not be regarded as a new model for Union super vision in other areas of financial 
services and activities.
(77) The Oversight framework should apply only to critical ICT third-par ty service provi ders. There should theref ore be a 
designation mech anism to take into account the dimension and nature of the financia l sector ’s reliance on such ICT 
third-par ty service providers. That mec hanism should involve a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to set the 
criticality paramete rs as a basis for inclusion in the Oversight Framew ork. In order to ensure the accuracy of that 
assessment, and regardl ess of the corporate structure of the ICT third-par ty service provider , such criteria should, in 
the case of a ICT third-par ty service provid er that is part of a wider group, take into consideration the entire ICT 
third-par ty service provider ’s group structure. On the one hand, critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers, which are 
not automatically designated by virtue of the application of those criteria, should have the possibility to opt in to the 
Oversight Framew ork on a voluntar y basis, on the other hand, ICT third-par ty service providers, that are already 
subject to oversight mechanism framew orks suppor ting the fulfilment of the tasks of the European System of 
Central Banks as refer red to in

================================================================================


Article 127: (2) TFEU, should be exem pted.

Legal Requirement:
(78) Similarly , financial entities provi ding ICT services to other financia l entities, while belonging to the categor y of ICT 
third-par ty service provid ers under this Regulation, should also be exem pted from the Oversight Framew ork since 
they are already subject to super visor y mechanisms established by the relevant Union financia l services law. Where 
applicable, compe tent authorities should take into account, in the conte xt of their super visor y activities, the ICT risk 
posed to financial entities by financial entities providin g ICT services. Likewise, due to the existing risk monitori ng 
mechani sms at group level, the same exem ption should be introduced for ICT third-par ty service provid ers 
deliver ing services predominantly to the entities of their own group. ICT third-par ty service provid ers provid ing 
ICT services solely in one Member State to financial entities that are active only in that Member State should also be 
exem pted from the designation mechanism because of their limited activities and lack of cross-border impact.
(79) The digital transf ormation exper ienced in financial services has brought about an unprecedented level of use of, and 
reliance upon, ICT services. Since it has become inconceivable to provid e financial services without the use of cloud 
computi ng services, software solutions and data-relate d services, the Union financial ecosystem has become 
intrinsically co-dependent on certain ICT services provided by ICT service suppliers. Some of those suppliers, 
innovat ors in developing and applying ICT-based technologies, play a signif icant role in the deliver y of financia l 
services, or have become integrat ed into the financia l services value chain. They have thus become critical to the 
stability and integrity of the Union financial system. This widespread reliance on services supplied by critical ICT 
third-par ty service provi ders, combined with the inter dependence of the information systems of various mark et 
operat ors, creat e a direct, and poten tially severe, risk to the Union financial services syste m and to the continuity of 
deliver y of financial services if critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers were to be affected by operational 
disruptions or major cyber incidents. Cyber incidents have a distinctive ability to multiply and propagat e 
throughout the financial system at a considerably faster pace than other types of risk monitor ed in the financial 
sector and can extend across sectors and beyond geographical borders. They have the poten tial to evolve into a 
systemic crisis, where trust in the financial system has been eroded due to the disruption of functions suppor ting 
the real economy , or to substantial financial losses, reac hing a level which the financial syste m is unable to 
withstand, or whic h requires the deplo yment of heavy shock absor ption measures. To prevent these scenar ios from 
taking place and thereb y endange ring the financial stability and integrity of the Union, it is essential to provide the 
converg ence of super visor y practices relating to ICT third-par ty risk in finance, in particular through new rules 
enabling the Union oversight of critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/17  
(80) The Oversight Framew ork largely depends on the degree of collaboration between the Lead Overseer and the critical 
ICT third-par ty service provider deliver ing to financia l entities services affect ing the supply of financial services. 
Successful oversight is predicat ed, inter alia, upon the ability of the Lead Overseer to effectively conduct monitoring 
missions and inspections to assess the rules, controls and processes used by the critical ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers, as well as to assess the potential cumulative impact of their activities on financial stability and the 
integrit y of the financial syste m. At the same time, it is crucial that critical ICT third-par ty service providers follow 
the Lead Overseer ’s recommendations and address its concer ns. Since a lack of cooperation by a critical ICT third-party service provider provid ing services that affect the supply of financial services, such as the refusal to grant 
access to its premises or to submit information, would ultimat ely depr ive the Lead Overseer of its essential tools in 
appraising ICT third-par ty risk, and could adversely imp act the financial stability and the integrity of the financial 
system, it is necessar y to also provid e for a commensurate sanctioning regime.
(81) Agai nst this backg round, the need of the Lead Overseer to impose penalty payments to compel critical ICT third-party service providers to compl y with the transparency and access-related oblig ations set out in this Regulation 
should not be jeopardised by difficulties raised by the enforcement of those penalty payments in relation to critical 
ICT third-par ty service providers established in third countr ies. In order to ensure the enforceability of such 
penalties, and to allow a swif t roll out of procedures upholding the critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers’ rights 
of defence in the context of the designation mechanism and the issuance of recommendations, those critical ICT 
third-par ty service provi ders, provid ing services to financial entities that affect the supply of financia l services, 
should be required to maintain an adequate business presence in the Union. Due to the nature of the oversight, and 
the absence of compar able arrangements in other jurisdictions, there are no suitable alternative mech anisms 
ensur ing this objective by way of effective cooperation with financial super visors in third countr ies in relation to the 
monitori ng of the impact of digital operational risks posed by systemic ICT third-par ty service providers, qualifying 
as critical ICT third-par ty service provi ders established in third countr ies. Theref ore, in order to continue its 
provision of ICT services to financial entities in the Union, an ICT third-par ty service provid er established in a third 
countr y which has been designat ed as critical in accordance with this Regulation should under take , within 12 
months of such designation, all necessar y arrangements to ensure its incor poration within the Union, by means of 
establishing a subsidiar y, as defined throughout the Union acquis, namely in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (21).
(82) The requirement to set up a subsidiar y in the Union should not prevent the critical ICT third-par ty service provi der 
from supplying ICT services and related technical suppor t from facilities and infrastr ucture located outside the 
Union. This Regulation does not impose a data localisation oblig ation as it does not require data storage or 
processing to be under take n in the Union.
(83) Critical ICT third-par ty service providers should be able to provi de ICT services from anywhere in the world, not 
necessar ily or not only from premises locat ed in the Union. Oversight activities should be first conduct ed on 
premises locat ed in the Union and by interacting with entities locat ed in the Union, including the subsidiar ies 
established by critical ICT third-par ty service providers pursuant to this Regulation. However , such actions within 
the Union might be insuffi cient to allow the Lead Overseer to fully and effectively perform its duties under this 
Regulation. The Lead Overseer should theref ore also be able to exercise its relevant oversight powers in third 
countr ies. Exercising those powers in third countr ies should allow the Lead Overseer to examine the facilities from 
which the ICT services or the technical suppor t services are actually provid ed or manage d by the critical ICT third-party service provider , and should give the Lead Overseer a comprehensive and operational understanding of the 
ICT risk manag ement of the critical ICT third-par ty service provid er. The possibility for the Lead Overseer , as a 
Union agency , to exercise powers outside the territory of the Union should be duly framed by relevant conditions, 
in particular the consent of the critical ICT third-par ty service provi der concer ned. Similarly , the relevant authorities 
of the third countr y should be informed of, and not have objected to, the exercise on their own territory of the 
activities of the Lead Overseer . However , in order to ensure efficient implementation, and without prejudice to the 
respective compet ences of the Union institutions and the Member States, such powers also need to be fully 
anch ored in the conclusion of administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant authorities of the third 
(21)Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, 
consolidated financial statements and related repor ts of certain types of under takings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/18 27.12.2022  
countr y concer ned. This Regulation should theref ore enable the ESAs to conclude administrative cooperation 
arrange ments with the relevant authorities of third countr ies, whic h should not other wise create legal oblig ations in 
respect of the Union and its Member States.
(84) To facilitate communication with the Lead Overseer and to ensure adequate representation, critical ICT third-par ty 
service provi ders which are part of a group should designat e one legal person as their coordination point.
(85) The Oversight Framew ork should be without prejudice to Member States’ compet ence to conduct their own 
oversight or monitoring missions in respect to ICT third-par ty service provi ders whic h are not designate d as critical 
under this Regulation, but whic h are rega rded as imp ortant at national level.
(86) To leverage the multi-la yered institutional archit ecture in the financial services area, the Joint Committ ee of the ESA s 
should continue to ensure overall cross-sect oral coordination in relation to all matte rs pertaining to ICT risk, in 
accordance with its tasks on cybersecurity. It should be suppor ted by a new Subcommitt ee (the ‘Oversight Forum’) 
carrying out preparatory work both for the individual decisions addressed to critical ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers, and for the issuing of collective recommendations, in particular in relation to benc hmarking the 
oversight programmes for critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers, and identifying best practices for addressing ICT 
concentration risk issues.
(87) To ensure that critical ICT third-par ty service provi ders are appropr iately and effectively overseen on a Union level, 
this Regulation provides that any of the three ESA s could be designate d as a Lead Overseer . The individual 
assignment of a critical ICT third-par ty service provid er to one of the three ESAs should result from an assessment 
of the preponderance of financia l entities operating in the financia l sectors for which that ESA has responsibilities. 
This approach should lead to a balanced allocation of tasks and responsibilities between the three ESA s, in the 
conte xt of exercising the oversight functions, and should make the best use of the human resources and technical 
exper tise available in each of the three ESA s.
(88) Lead Overseers should be grant ed the necessar y powers to conduct investig ations, to carry out onsit e and offsite 
inspections at the premises and locations of critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers and to obtain compl ete and 
update d information. Those powers should enable the Lead Overseer to acquire real insight into the type, 
dimension and impact of the ICT third-par ty risk posed to financia l entities and ultimat ely to the Union’s financial 
system. Entr usting the ESA s with the lead oversight role is a prerequisite for understanding and addressing the 
systemic dimension of ICT risk in finance. The impact of critical ICT third-par ty service providers on the Union 
financial sector and the potential issues caused by the ICT concentration risk entailed call for taking a collective 
approach at Union level. The simultaneous carrying out of multiple audits and access rights, performed separate ly 
by numerous compe tent authorities, with little or no coordination among them, would prevent financial 
super visors from obtaining a compl ete and compre hensive overview of ICT third-par ty risk in the Union, while also 
creating redundancy , burden and compl exity for critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers if they were subject to 
numerous monitori ng and inspection requests.
(89) Due to the signif icant impact of being designated as critical, this Regulation should ensure that the rights of critical 
ICT third-par ty service provi ders are obser ved throughout the implementation of the Oversight Framew ork. Prior 
to being designated as critical, such provid ers should, for example, have the right to submit to the Lead Overseer a 
reasoned statement containing any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment related to their 
designation. Since the Lead Overseer should be empowered to submit recommendations on ICT risk matte rs and 
suitable remedies theret o, which include the power to oppose certain contractual arrangements ultimat ely affect ing 
the stability of the financial entity or the financial syste m, critical ICT third-par ty service provi ders should also be 
given the oppor tunity to provide, prior to the finalisation of those recommendations, explanations regarding the 
expecte d impact of the solutions, envisaged in the recommendations, on customers that are entities falling outside 
the scope of this Regulation and to formulate solutions to mitig ate risks. Critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/19  
disagreeing with the recommendations should submit a reasoned explanation of their intention not to endorse the 
recommendation. Where such reasoned explanation is not submitted or where it is considered to be insuffic ient, the 
Lead Overseer should issue a public notice summar ily descr ibing the matte r of non-com pliance.
(90) Com petent authorities should duly include the task of verifying substantive compl iance with recommendations 
issued by the Lead Overseer in their functions with regar d to prudential super vision of financial entities. Com petent 
authorities should be able to require financial entities to take additional measures to address the risks identified in the 
Lead Overseer ’s recommendations, and should, in due course, issue notifi cations to that effect. Where the Lead 
Overseer addresses recommendations to critical ICT third-par ty service providers that are super vised under 
Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the compe tent authorities should be able, on a voluntary basis and before adopt ing 
additional measures, to consult the compet ent authorities under that Directive in order to foster a coordinat ed 
approach to dealing with the critical ICT third-par ty service providers in question.
(91) The exercise of the oversight should be guided by three operational principles seeking to ensure: (a) close 
coordination among the ESAs in their Lead Overseer roles, through a joint oversight netw ork (JON), (b) consist ency 
with the framewor k established by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (through a voluntar y consultation of bodies under that 
Directive to avoid duplication of measures direct ed at critical ICT third-par ty service providers), and (c) applying 
dilig ence to minimise the pote ntial risk of disruption to services provided by the critical ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers to customer s that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation.
(92) The Oversight Framew ork should not replace, or in any way or for any part substitute for, the requirement for 
financial entities to manage themselves the risks entailed by the use of ICT third-par ty service provid ers, including 
their obligation to maintain an ongoing monitori ng of contractual arrangements concluded with critical ICT third-party service provid ers. Similarly , the Oversight Framew ork should not affect the full responsibility of financia l 
entities for compl ying with, and disc harging, all the legal oblig ations laid down in this Regulation and in the 
relevant financial services law.
(93) To avoid duplications and overlaps, compet ent authorities should refrain from taking individually any measures 
aiming to monitor the critical ICT third-par ty service provider ’s risks and should, in that respect, rely on the 
relevant Lead Overseer ’s assessment. Any measures should in any case be coordinat ed and agreed in advance with 
the Lead Overseer in the cont ext of the exercise of tasks in the Oversight Framew ork.
(94) To promot e converg ence at international level as regar ds the use of best practices in the review and monitori ng of 
ICT third-par ty service provid ers’ digital risk-management, the ESAs should be encourag ed to conclude cooperation 
arrange ments with relevant super visor y and regulatory third-countr y authorities.
(95) To leverage the specif ic compe tences, technical skills and exper tise of staff specialising in operational and ICT risk 
within the compet ent authorities, the three ESA s and, on a voluntar y basis, the compe tent authorities under 
Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the Lead Overseer should draw on national super visor y capabilities and kno wledge and 
set up dedicated examination teams for each critical ICT third-par ty service provider , pooling multidisciplinar y 
teams in suppor t of the preparation and execution of oversight activities, including general inve stigations and 
inspections of critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers, as well as for any necessar y follow-up thereto.
(96) Whereas costs resulting from oversight task s would be fully funded from fees levied on critical ICT third-par ty 
service provid ers, the ESA s are. however , likely to incur , before the start of the Oversight Framew ork, costs for the 
imp lementation of dedicat ed ICT syste ms suppor ting the upcoming oversight, since dedicat ed ICT syste ms would 
need to be developed and deplo yed beforehand. This Regulation theref ore provi des for a hybrid funding model, 
whereby the Oversight Framew ork would, as such, be fully fee-funded, while the development of the ESAs’ ICT 
systems would be funded from Union and national compet ent authorities’ contr ibutions.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/20 27.12.2022  
(97) Com petent authorities should have all required super visor y, investig ative and sanctioning powers to ensure the 
proper exercise of their duties under this Regulation. They should, in principle, publish notices of the administrative 
penalties they impose. Since financial entities and ICT third-par ty service providers can be established in different 
Member State s and super vised by differ ent compe tent authorities, the application of this Regulation should be 
facilitated by, on the one hand, close cooperation among relevant compe tent authorities, including the ECB with 
regard to specific tasks conferred on it by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, and, on the other hand, by 
consultation with the ESA s through the mutual exchange of information and the provision of assistance in the 
conte xt of relevant super visor y activities.
(98) In order to further quantify and qualify the criteria for the designation of ICT third-par ty service provid ers as critical 
and to harmonise oversight fees, the power to adopt acts in accordance with

Legal Requirement:
to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by further specifying the system ic impa ct that a failure or 
operational outage of an ICT third-par ty service provider could have on the financial entities it provides ICT services 
to, the number of global systemically impor tant institutions (G-SIIs), or other syste mically impor tant institutions 
(O-SIIs), that rely on the ICT third-par ty service provid er in question, the number of ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers active on a given mark et, the costs of migrating data and ICT workloads to other ICT third-par ty service 
provid ers, as well as the amount of the oversight fees and the way in which they are to be paid. It is of particular 
imp ortance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparatory work, including at 
exper t level, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interin sti­
tutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Better Law-Making (22). In particular , to ensure equal participation in the 
preparation of delega ted acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same 
time as Member State s’ exper ts, and their exper ts should syste matically have access to meetings of Commission 
exper t groups dealing with the preparation of delega ted acts.
(99) Regulat ory technical standards should ensure the consistent harmonisation of the requirements laid down in this 
Regulation. In their roles as bodies endowed with highly specialised exper tise, the ESAs should develop draf t 
regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission. Regulat ory 
technical standards should be developed in the areas of ICT risk manag ement, major ICT-related incident repor ting, 
testing, as well as in relation to key requirements for a sound monitoring of ICT third-par ty risk. The Commission 
and the ESA s should ensure that those standards and requirements can be applied by all financia l entities in a 
manner that is propor tionate to their size and overall risk prof ile, and the nature, scale and complexity of their 
services, activities and operations. The Commission should be empo wered to adop t those regulator y technical 
standards by means of delega ted acts pursuant to

Article 291: TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU)

Legal Requirement:
No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.
(22)OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/21  
(101) Since further requirements have already been specifi ed through delegat ed and imple menting acts based on technical 
regulatory and implementing technical standards in Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 (23), (EU) No 648/2012 (24), 
(EU) No 600/2014 (25)and (EU) No 909/2014 (26)of the European Parliament and of the Council, it is appropr iate 
to mandate the ESAs, either individually or jointly through the Joint Committee, to submit regulator y and 
imp lementing technical standards to the Commission for adop tion of delegat ed and implementing acts carrying 
over and updating existing ICT risk management rules.
(102) Since this Regulation, together with Directive (EU) 2022/2556 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), 
entails a consolidation of the ICT risk manag ement provi sions across multiple regulations and directives of the 
Union’s financial services acquis, including Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014 
and (EU) No 909/2014, and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28), in 
order to ensure full consiste ncy, those Regulations should be amended to clarify that the applicable ICT risk-relat ed 
provisions are laid down in this Regulation.
(103) Consequently , the scope of the relevant articles related to operational risk, upon which empo werments laid down in 
Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014, (EU) No 909/2014, and (EU) 2016/1011 
had mandated the adop tion of delegat ed and implementing acts, should be narrowed down with a view to carry 
over into this Regulation all provisions covering the digital operational resilience aspects whic h toda y are part of 
those Regulations.
(104) The poten tial syste mic cyber risk associate d with the use of ICT infrastr uctures that enable the operation of payment 
systems and the provis ion of payment processing activities should be duly addressed at Union level through 
harmonised digital resilience rules. To that effect, the Commission should swif tly assess the need for reviewing the 
scope of this Regulation while aligning such review with the outcome of the compreh ensive review envisaged under 
Directive (EU) 2015/2366. Numerous large-scale attacks over the past decade demonstrate how payment systems 
have become exposed to cyber threats. Placed at the core of the payment services chain and showing strong 
inter connections with the overall financial system, payment systems and payment processing activities acquired a 
critical signif icance for the functioning of the Union financia l mark ets. Cyber -attacks on such systems can cause 
severe operational business disruptions with direct repercussions on key economic functions, such as the facilitation 
of payments, and indirect effects on relat ed economic processes. Until a harmonised regime and the super vision of 
operat ors of payment systems and processing entities are put in place at Union level, Member States may, with a 
view to applying similar market practices, draw inspiration from the digital operational resilience requirements laid 
down by this Regulation, when applying rules to operators of payment syste ms and processing entities super vised 
under their own jurisdictions.

(105) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to achieve a high level of digital operational resilience for regulated 
financial entities, cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member States because it requires harmonisation of various 
differ ent rules in Union and national law, but can rather , by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union 
level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in

Legal Requirement:
1. For the purpose of ensur ing the restoration of ICT system s and data with minimum downt ime, limited disrupti on and 
loss, as part of their ICT risk management framewor k, financial entities shall develop and document:
(a) backup policies and procedures specifying the scope of the data that is subject to the backup and the minimum 
frequency of the backup, based on the criticality of information or the conf identiality level of the data;
(b) restoration and recovery procedures and methods.
2. Financial entities shall set up backup system s that can be activat ed in accordance with the backup policies and 
procedures, as well as restoration and recovery procedures and methods. The activation of backup systems shall not 
jeopardise the security of the network and information systems or the availability , authenticity , integrit y or confidentiality 
of data. testing of the backup procedures and restoration and recovery procedures and methods shall be under take n 
periodically .
3. When restor ing backup data using own syste ms, financia l entities shall use ICT systems that are physically and 
logically segregat ed from the source ICT system. The ICT systems shall be securely protect ed from any unauthor ised access 
or ICT corrupti on and allow for the timely restoration of services making use of data and system backups as necessar y.
For central counter parties, the reco very plans shall enable the recovery of all transactions at the time of disruption to allow 
the central counter party to continue to operat e with certainty and to compl ete settlement on the scheduled date.
Data repor ting service providers shall additionally maintain adequate resources and have back -up and restoration facilities 
in place in order to offer and maintain their services at all times.
4. Financial entities, other than microent erprises, shall maintain redundant ICT capacities equipped with resources, 
capabilities and functions that are adequate to ensure business needs. Microenter prises shall assess the need to maintain 
such redundant ICT capacities based on their risk profile.
5. Central secur ities deposit ories shall maintain at least one secondar y processing site endowed with adequat e resources, 
capabilities, functions and staffing arrangements to ensure business needs.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/35  
The secondar y processing site shall be:
(a) located at a geographical distance from the primar y processing site to ensure that it bears a distinct risk prof ile and to 
prevent it from being affected by the event which has affect ed the primar y site;
(b) capable of ensur ing the continuity of critical or impor tant functions identically to the primar y site, or provi ding the 
level of services necessar y to ensure that the financia l entity performs its critical operations within the reco very 
objectives;
(c) immediately accessible to the financial entity’s staff to ensure continuity of critical or important functions in the event 
that the primar y processing site has become unavailable.
6. In deter mining the recovery time and reco very point objectives for each function, financia l entities shall take into 
account whether it is a critical or impor tant function and the potential overall imp act on mark et efficiency . Such time 
objectives shall ensure that, in extreme scenar ios, the agreed service levels are met.
7. When recoveri ng from an ICT-relat ed incident, financial entities shall perf orm necessar y checks, including any 
multiple checks and reconciliations, in order to ensure that the highest level of data integr ity is maintained. These checks 
shall also be performed when reconstr ucting data from external stakeho lders, in order to ensure that all data is consiste nt

Legal Requirement:
which are identif ied in accordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry out at least ever y 3 
years advanced testing by means of TLPT . Based on the risk prof ile of the financial entity and taking into account 
operational circumstances, the compet ent author ity may, where necessar y, request the financial entity to reduce or 
increase this frequency .
2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or important functions of a financia l entity , and shall 
be performe d on live production systems suppor ting such functions.
Financial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems, processes and technologies suppor ting critical or 
imp ortant functions and ICT services, including those suppor ting the critical or important functions which have been 
outsourced or contracted to ICT third-par ty service providers.
Financial entities shall assess whic h critical or impor tant functions need to be covered by the TLPT . The result of this 
assessment shall determine the precise scope of TLPT and shall be validat ed by the compe tent authorities.
3. Where ICT third-par ty service provi ders are included in the scope of TLPT , the financial entity shall take the necessar y 
measures and safeg uards to ensure the participation of such ICT third-par ty service provi ders in the TLPT and shall retain at 
all times full responsibility for ensur ing compliance with this Regulation.
4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where the participation of an ICT third-par ty 
service provider in the TLPT , refer red to in paragraph 3, is reasonably expecte d to have an adverse impact on the quality or 
security of services delivered by the ICT third-par ty service provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope 
of this Regulation, or on the conf identiality of the data related to such services, the financia l entity and the ICT third-par ty 
service provi der may agree in writing that the ICT third-par ty service provid er directly enters into contractual arrange ments 
with an extern al tester, for the purpose of conducting, under the direction of one designated financia l entity , a pooled TLPT 
involving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT third-par ty service provider provides ICT services.
That pooled testin g shall cover the relevant range of ICT services suppor ting critical or important functions contracted to 
the respective ICT third-par ty service provid er by the financia l entities. The pooled testing shall be considered TLPT carried 
out by the financial entities participating in the pooled testing.
The number of financia l entities participating in the pooled testing shall be duly calibrated taking into account the 
compl exity and types of services involved.
5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-par ty service provid ers and other parties involved, including 
the testers but excluding the compet ent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitig ate the risks of any 
poten tial impact on data, damage to assets, and disrupti on to critical or important functions, services or operations at the 
financial entity itself, its counter parts or to the financial sector.
6. At the end of the testing, after repor ts and remediation plans have been agreed, the financial entity and, where 
applicable, the extern al testers shall provide to the author ity, designat ed in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a summar y 
of the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation demonstrating that the TLPT has been conduct ed in 
accordance with the requirements.
7. authorities shall provide financial entities with an attes tation conf irming that the test was performe d in accordance

Legal Requirement:
shall also take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrange ment in relation to ICT services 
suppor ting critical or impor tant functions would lead to any of the followi ng:
(a) contracting an ICT third-par ty service provid er that is not easily substitutable; or
(b) having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services suppor ting critical or 
impor tant functions with the same ICT third-par ty service provid er or with closely connected ICT third-par ty service 
providers.
Financial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternati ve solutions, such as the use of diffe rent ICT third-par ty 
service provid ers, taking into account if and how envisag ed solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in 
their digital resilience strateg y.
2. Where the contractual arrange ments on the use of ICT services suppor ting critical or important functions include the 
possibility that an ICT third-par ty service provi der further subcontracts ICT services suppor ting a critical or imp ortant 
function to other ICT third-par ty service provid ers, financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in 
connection with such subcontracting, in particular in the case of an ICT subcontract or established in a third-countr y.
Where contractual arrangements concer n ICT services suppor ting critical or impor tant functions, financial entities shall 
duly consider the insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of the ICT third-par ty service provider ’s 
bankr uptcy as well as any constraint that may arise in respect to the urgent recovery of the financial entity’s data.
Where contractual arrange ments on the use of ICT services suppor ting critical or important functions are concluded with 
an ICT third-par ty service provider established in a third countr y, financial entities shall, in addition to the considerations 
refer red to in the second subparagraph, also consider the compl iance with Union data protection rules and the effective 
enforcement of the law in that third countr y.
Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services suppor ting critical or imp ortant functions provide for 
subcontracting, financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or compl ex chains of subcontracting may 
imp act their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the compet ent author ity to effectively

Article 32: (1), shall:

Legal Requirement:
(a) designate the ICT third-par ty service provi ders that are critical for financial entities, follo wing an assessment that takes 
into account the criteria specified in paragraph 2;EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 27.12.2022 L 333/53  
(b) appoint as Lead Overseer for each critical ICT third-par ty service provider the ESA that is responsible, in accordance 
with Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 or (EU) No 1095/2010, for the financia l entities having 
together the largest share of tota l assets out of the value of tota l assets of all financial entities using the services of the 
relevant critical ICT third-par ty service provider , as evidenced by the sum of the individual balance sheets of those 
financial entities.
2. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall be based on all of the followi ng criteria in relation to ICT 
services provided by the ICT third-par ty service provider :
(a) the systemic impact on the stability , continuity or quality of the provi sion of financial services in the event that the 
relevant ICT third-par ty service provider would face a large scale operational failure to provide its services, taking into 
account the number of financia l entities and the total value of assets of financial entities to which the relevant ICT 
third-par ty service provid er provid es services;
(b) the system ic character or impor tance of the financial entities that rely on the relevant ICT third-par ty service provi der, 
assessed in accordance with the following parameter s:
(i) the number of global systemical ly impor tant institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemical ly impor tant institutions 
(O-SIIs) that rely on the respective ICT third-par ty service provid er;
(ii) the interdependence between the G-SIIs or O-SIIs refer red to in point (i) and other financial entities, including 
situations where the G-SIIs or O-SIIs provid e financial infrastr ucture services to other financial entities;
(c) the reliance of financia l entities on the services provid ed by the relevant ICT third-par ty service provi der in relation to 
critical or impor tant functions of financial entities that ultimat ely involve the same ICT third-par ty service provider , 
irrespective of whether financial entities rely on those services directly or indirectly , through subcontracting 
arrangements;
(d) the degree of substitutability of the ICT third-par ty service provider , taking into account the follo wing parameters:
(i) the lack of real altern atives, even partial, due to the limited number of ICT third-par ty service providers active on a 
specific market, or the mark et share of the relevant ICT third-par ty service provid er, or the technical compl exity or 
sophistication involved, including in relation to any propr ietar y technology , or the specifi c features of the ICT 
third-par ty service provider ’s organisation or activity ;
(ii) difficulties in relation to partially or fully migrating the relevant data and workloads from the relevant ICT third-party service provid er to another ICT third-par ty service provider , due either to signif icant financial costs, time or 
other resources that the migration process may entail, or to increased ICT risk or other operational risks to which 
the financial entity may be exposed through such migration.
3. Where the ICT third-par ty service provi der belongs to a group, the criteria refer red to in paragraph 2 shall be 
considered in relation to the ICT services provided by the group as a whole.
4. Critical ICT third-par ty service provid ers which are part of a group shall designat e one legal person as a coordination 
point to ensure adequate representation and communication with the Lead Overseer .
5. The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-par ty service provid er of the outcome of the assessment leading to the 
designation refer red in paragraph 1, point (a). Within 6 weeks from the date of the notification, the ICT third-par ty service 
provid er may submit to the Lead Overseer a reasoned statement with any relevant information for the purposes of the 
assessment. The Lead Overseer shall consider the reasoned statement and may request additional information to be 
submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of such statemen t.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 333/54 27.12.2022  
After designating an ICT third-par ty service provid er as critical, the ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall notify the ICT 
third-par ty service provid er of such designation and the starting date as from whic h they will effectively be subject to 
oversight activities. That starting date shall be no later than one month after the notific ation. The ICT third-par ty service 
provid er shall notify the financia l entities to which they provid e services of their designation as critical.
