Identify Function Controls:
- Asset Management and Inventory (ID.AM): Implement an automated asset discovery and management system to maintain an up-to-date inventory of all ICT assets, including hardware, software, and data. Classify assets based on criticality and sensitivity, as required by DORA Article 9.

- Governance Structure (ID.GV): Establish a clear governance structure for ICT risk management, including board-level oversight and a designated senior executive responsible for digital operational resilience, as outlined in DORA Article 4.

- Regulatory Compliance Mapping (ID.GV): Develop a comprehensive mapping of all applicable regulatory requirements, including DORA, to ensure full compliance across all ICT systems and processes.


Protect Function Controls:
- Access Control and Identity Management (PR.AC): Implement a robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) system with multi-factor authentication, least privilege principles, and regular access reviews. Ensure alignment with DORA Article 8 requirements for ICT security.

- Data Protection and Encryption (PR.DS): Deploy comprehensive data protection measures, including encryption for data at rest and in transit, data loss prevention tools, and secure data disposal methods. Address DORA Article 10 requirements for data and system backup.

- Secure Configuration Management (PR.IP): Establish processes for secure configuration management of all ICT systems, including hardening guidelines, patch management, and change control procedures. Align with DORA Article 8 on ICT security policies.


Detect Function Controls:
- Security Information and Event Management (DE.AE): Deploy an advanced SIEM solution to collect, correlate, and analyze security events across all ICT systems. Configure automated alerting based on predefined rules and anomaly detection algorithms, addressing DORA Article 11 on ICT-related incident detection.

- Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): Establish a 24/7 security monitoring capability, including network and endpoint monitoring, user behavior analytics, and threat hunting activities. Align with DORA Article 10 requirements for continuous monitoring mechanisms.

- Anomaly Detection (DE.AE): Develop and implement machine learning-based anomaly detection capabilities to identify unusual patterns in system behavior, network traffic, and user activities that may indicate security incidents.


Respond Function Controls:
- Crisis Communication Plan (RS.CO): Establish a crisis communication plan that includes procedures for notifying internal stakeholders, customers, regulators, and the public about significant ICT incidents. Ensure compliance with DORA Article 15 on incident reporting to competent authorities.

- Automated Incident Response (RS.MI): Implement automated incident response capabilities for common types of security incidents, including predefined playbooks and integration with security tools for rapid containment and mitigation.

- Incident Classification and Triage (RS.AN): Implement a standardized incident classification and triage process to ensure appropriate prioritization and allocation of resources during incident response, in line with DORA Article 16 requirements.


Recover Function Controls:
- ICT Service Continuity Testing (RC.RP): Conduct regular ICT service continuity tests, including full-scale disaster recovery exercises and failover testing for critical systems. Ensure compliance with DORA Article 23 on advanced testing of ICT tools, systems, and processes.

- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (RC.RP): Develop, implement, and regularly test comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans for all critical ICT systems and services. Ensure alignment with DORA Article 11 on digital operational resilience testing.

- Data and System Recovery (RC.RP): Implement and regularly test data and system recovery procedures, including point-in-time recovery capabilities and validation of data integrity post-recovery. Align with DORA Article 10 requirements for backup policies and restoration.
