# DORA Controls Analyzer

A comprehensive tool for analyzing compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA - EU Regulation 2022/2554) by identifying gaps between your organization's policies and DORA requirements.

## Overview

The DORA Compliance Analyzer processes the official DORA legislation (CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf) and compares it against your organization's policy documents to:

1. Extract Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) requirements from DORA
2. Analyze your organization's policy documents for compliance coverage
3. Identify gaps in your compliance posture
4. Generate detailed gap analysis reports with recommendations

## What are RTS and ITS?

**Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)** and **Implementing Technical Standards (ITS)** are detailed technical requirements specified within the DORA legislation:

- **RTS**: Define the technical standards and specifications that regulated entities must adhere to. These are more detailed than the main legislation and specify "what" needs to be implemented.

- **ITS**: Describe specific procedures, forms, templates and methods for implementing the requirements. These focus on "how" the implementation should be done.

Both types of standards are crucial for compliance with DORA and are developed by European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) to ensure consistent implementation across EU member states.

## Features

- **Automated Extraction**: Extracts Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) requirements from the DORA legislation
- **Semantic Analysis**: Uses advanced NLP (spaCy and transformers) to analyze policy coverage
- **Multi-Policy Support**: Processes multiple policy documents in parallel
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed compliance gap analysis reports
- **Performance Optimized**: Implements memory management and caching for efficient processing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable thresholds and processing parameters

## Advanced Analysis Capabilities

The tool includes sophisticated analysis features to provide more accurate and actionable results:

1. **DORA Relevance Screening**: Automatically identifies which policies are relevant to DORA compliance based on content analysis, filtering out irrelevant documents to focus analysis on meaningful targets.

2. **Policy Focus Detection**: Intelligently determines each policy's intended focus areas (e.g., authentication, risk management, incident response) based on document title and content analysis.

3. **Context-Aware Gap Analysis**: Distinguishes between:
   - **Relevant Gaps**: Missing requirements that fall within a policy's intended scope
   - **Informational Gaps**: Requirements that are outside a policy's scope and should be covered elsewhere

4. **Article-Specific Analysis**: Provides detailed information about each gap including:
   - The specific DORA article and requirement text
   - The policy that should cover it
   - Similarity scores showing how close existing policies come to meeting the requirement
   - Detailed reasons why the requirement is considered not covered

5. **Tailored Recommendations**: Generates policy-specific recommendations based on:
   - Each policy's focus areas
   - The nature and severity of identified gaps
   - Whether new policies are needed or existing ones should be enhanced

These advanced capabilities ensure you receive a realistic, context-sensitive gap analysis that respects the specialized nature of different policy documents.

# Edit dora.py and modify:
DORAConfig.BATCH_SIZE = 5  # Reduce from default 10
```

## Directory Structure

Before running the analyzer, ensure your files are organized as follows:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dora.py                      # Main analyzer code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf  # DORA legislation PDF
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ policies/                    # Your organization's policy documents
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ policy1.pdf
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ policy2.pdf
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Note:** The `policies` folder will be created automatically if it doesn't exist. This is where you should place all your organization's policy documents in PDF format for analysis.

## Running the Analyzer

## Two Analysis Approaches

The DORA Controls Analyzer provides **two different analysis approaches** depending on your needs:

### 1. Main Analysis Tool: `dora.py` (Recommended for most users)

**Use this for comprehensive gap analysis:**

```bash
python dora.py
```

**What it does:**
- Extracts RTS and ITS requirements directly from DORA legislation
- Analyzes your policy documents for compliance coverage using semantic similarity
- Generates detailed text-based gap analysis reports with article-specific findings
- Handles multiple policies in parallel with intelligent relevance screening
- Provides context-aware recommendations based on policy focus areas

**Use this when:**
- You want a complete DORA compliance assessment
- You need detailed gap analysis with specific recommendations
- You prefer comprehensive text-based reports
- You're doing an initial compliance assessment

### 2. Domain-Specific Analysis: `dora_workbook_integration.py` (For structured reporting)

**Use this for SOC2-style domain organization:**

```bash
python -m WorkShop.dora_workbook_integration
```

**What it does:**
- Organizes DORA into 8 structured domains (similar to SOC2 approach)
- Maps your policies to specific DORA domains and controls
- Generates Excel reports with charts, pivot tables, and visual dashboards
- Provides domain-by-domain compliance scoring and tracking

**Use this when:**
- You need Excel-based reports for management presentations
- You want SOC2-style domain organization and tracking
- You're monitoring ongoing compliance across structured domains
- You need visual dashboards and charts for compliance teams

### Quick Decision Guide

```bash
# For comprehensive text-based gap analysis (most users):
python dora.py

# For domain-specific Excel reports (compliance teams):
python -m WorkShop.dora_workbook_integration

# You can run both tools - they complement each other!
```

### Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Prepare the DORA legislation file**:
   - Place the DORA legislation PDF (CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf) in the root directory
   - You can download it from the [Official EU Law website](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2554)

2. **Prepare your policy documents**:
   - Place your PDF policy documents in the `policies` folder
   - If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically on first run
   - Each PDF should be a separate policy or standard document

3. **Run the analyzer**:
   ```bash
   # From the project root directory
   python dora.py
   ```

4. **View the results**:
   - The analysis logs will be displayed in the console
   - A detailed gap analysis report will be generated in the `analysis_output` folder
   - Additional logs are stored in `dora_analyzer.log`

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the analyzer's behavior by modifying settings in the `DORAConfig` class:

```python
# Example: Adjust similarity thresholds for more lenient matching
DORAConfig.STRONG_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Lower from default 0.6
DORAConfig.COVERAGE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Lower from default 0.7
DORAConfig.FINAL_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Lower from default 0.8

# Example: Increase text chunk size for processing larger documents
DORAConfig.MAX_TEXT_CHUNK_SIZE = 50000  # Default is 25000
```

To run with modified settings, you can create a custom script:

```python
# custom_run.py
from dora import DORAComplianceAnalyzer, DORAConfig

# Modify configuration
DORAConfig.STRONG_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.5
DORAConfig.COVERAGE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.6
DORAConfig.FINAL_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.7

# Run analysis
analyzer = DORAComplianceAnalyzer("CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf")
analyzer.extract_technical_standards()
# Process each policy in the policies directory
# ...
analyzer.generate_gap_analysis_report()
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Easiest - Recommended)

**Just download and run - no manual configuration needed!**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/asko123/dora_controls.git

pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# Create policies folder and add your PDFs
mkdir -p policies
cp /path/to/your/policies/*.pdf policies/

# Download DORA legislation if needed
# wget https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2554 -O CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf

# Run the analyzer (will be slower without GPU)
python dora.py
```

## Example Command Sequence

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/asko123/dora_controls.git
cd dora_controls

# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# Download DORA legislation if needed
# wget https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2554 -O CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf

# The policies folder will be created automatically on first run
# You can check if it exists or create it manually
if [ ! -d "policies" ]; then
    mkdir -p policies
    echo "Created policies folder. Please add your policy PDFs here."
fi

# Add your policy documents to the policies folder
cp /path/to/your/policies/*.pdf policies/

# Run the analyzer
python dora.py

# View the generated report (contains RTS and ITS compliance analysis)
cat analysis_output/dora_gap_analysis_*.txt
```

## Output Files

The analyzer generates the following outputs:

1. **Log File**: `dora_analyzer.log` - Contains detailed logs of the analysis process

2. **Gap Analysis Report**: Located in the `analysis_output` directory with filename format `dora_gap_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

3. **Cache Files**: Located in the `.cache` directory (for improved performance on subsequent runs)

## Interpreting Results

The gap analysis report includes:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overall compliance coverage percentage
2. **Policy Coverage Summary**: Per-policy coverage of Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) requirements with policy focus areas
3. **Detailed Gap Analysis**: Article-by-article breakdown of gaps with clear distinction between:
   - Relevant gaps that need addressing within existing policies
   - Informational gaps that are outside a policy's scope
4. **Recommendations**: Policy-specific actions to improve compliance

A high coverage score (>80%) indicates good alignment with DORA requirements, while lower scores highlight areas needing attention.

## Customizing Analysis

You can adjust the analysis behavior by modifying the `DORAConfig` class in the code. Key settings include:

- **Similarity Thresholds**:
  - `STRONG_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.6` - Threshold for strong semantic matches
  - `COVERAGE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.7` - Threshold for section matches
  - `FINAL_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.8` - Threshold for considering a requirement covered

- **Model Configuration**:
  - Uses `nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased` for policy area classification (specifically trained on legal and regulatory texts)
  - Uses `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` for semantic similarity calculation (superior performance on complex regulatory text)

## Model Selection

The DORA Controls Analyzer uses specialized models optimized for legal and regulatory text analysis:

1. **LegalBERT (`nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased`)**: 
   - Pre-trained specifically on legal and regulatory documents
   - Shows 5-10% improved performance on legal classification tasks compared to general-purpose models
   - Better recognition of legal terminology and regulatory concepts

2. **MPNet (`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`)**: 
   - Consistently outperforms other semantic similarity models by 2-5% on complex text benchmarks
   - Better matching for regulatory requirements with legal/technical terminology
   - More accurate similarity scores for compliance matching

These specialized models enable more accurate identification of policy areas and better matching between DORA requirements and policy documents, resulting in more reliable gap analysis results.

## Troubleshooting

- **Memory Errors**: Reduce the `MAX_TEXT_CHUNK_SIZE` in DORAConfig
- **Slow Processing**: Use a GPU or increase `BATCH_SIZE` for parallel processing
- **Low Coverage**: Adjust similarity thresholds in DORAConfig
- **Missing DORA File**: Ensure the DORA legislation PDF is in the root directory with the exact name "CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf"
- **No Policies Found**: Make sure your policy PDFs are in the "policies" folder. The folder will be created automatically on first run, but you need to manually add your PDF files to it before analysis
- **Irrelevant Results**: The tool automatically screens documents for DORA relevance, but you can adjust the screening logic in the `is_dora_relevant` function if needed

## DORA Compliance Workbook

The DORA Controls Analyzer now includes a structured compliance workbook that categorizes DORA requirements into domains similar to SOC2. This feature:

1. **Organizes DORA into Domains**: Breaks down DORA into 8 key domains with specific controls:
   - ICT Risk Management
   - ICT Incident Management
   - Digital Testing
   - Third-Party Risk
   - Information Sharing
   - Business Continuity
   - Awareness & Training
   - Governance & Oversight

2. **Domain-Specific Analysis**: Maps your policies to specific DORA domains and controls with precise matching.

3. **Comprehensive Excel Reports**: Generates detailed workbooks with:
   - Color-coded compliance status by domain
   - Pivot tables showing coverage across all domains
   - Charts visualizing domain compliance
   - Similarity scores for each requirement

### Using the DORA Workbook

You can run the workbook analysis using:

```python
from WorkShop.dora_workbook_integration import run_workbook_analysis

# Run analysis and generate Excel report
report_path = run_workbook_analysis(
    dora_path="CELEX_32022R2554_EN_TXT.pdf",
    policies_folder="policies"
)
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
# Generate a domain-specific compliance report
python -m WorkShop.dora_workbook_integration
```

The workbook functionality is ideal for compliance teams that need to map DORA requirements to specific controls and track compliance status across domains.
